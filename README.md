# bikram-sambat.sql (Bikram Sambat implementation in PostgreSQL)


 The Bikrami calendar is similar in concept to the Gregorian calendar, although it is not the same as the Jewish calendar. Unlike the Gregorian calendar, which adds extra days to the lunar month to help make up for the mismatch between twelve lunar cycles (354 lunar days) and nearly 365 solar days, the Bikrami and Jewish calendars retain the lunar month's integrity while inserting an extra full month every 4 years, as according complex rules, to ensure that festivals and crop-related rituals fall in the appropriate season. This Indian calendar system is one of the lunisolar calendars developed by ancient human cultures.
